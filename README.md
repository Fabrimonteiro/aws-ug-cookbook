# AWS User Group Cookbook

Welcome to the **AWS User Group Cookbook**, a collaborative resource designed to help AWS User Groups (also known as AWS UGs) around the globe share their experiences, best practices, and creative strategies for organizing and running successful community events.

By leveraging the collective wisdom of AWS user groups worldwide, we can all improve our local communities and make them more vibrant, inclusive, and impactful.
